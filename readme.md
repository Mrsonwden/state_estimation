# target:
***
    The project's project is to understand state estimate deeply.

# Scheme:
***
## project1: LG & KF & car
    step1: generate line in 2D space, x represent distanse in m unit,  y represent distance in km unit. the will as gt;
    step2: same as step1, but add noise in x  & y since second item.
    step3: give motion equation & observation equation & init value of x. use lg_kf to estamate the value x from item 2 to the end.
    step4: calculate diff between gt and dt;

# Process:
    1. LG KF finished 20230716
